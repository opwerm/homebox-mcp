# Everything goes through here; CI runs the same recipes.

# Build and vet.
#
# Builds the COMMAND explicitly, not just ./... — a repo whose main package
# is missing still passes `go build ./...`, because the library packages
# compile on their own. That is exactly how cmd/ got left out of the first
# release: .gitignore swallowed it and every check stayed green.
check:
    go vet ./...
    go test ./...
    go build ./...
    go build -o /dev/null ./cmd/homebox-mcp

# Lint and render the chart, and prove its guards still refuse bad input.
#
# A chart exercised only with correct values has not been tested: the
# schema and the required-value guards exist to REJECT things, so the
# checks that matter are the ones expecting failure.

# KO_DOCKER_REPO is required even when publishing is skipped -- ko needs a
# repository to name the image it builds, and fails before building without
# one. CI passes the real registry; locally any name will do, and ko.local
# keeps the result out of a registry namespace that means something.
