# Architecture

A single Go binary that translates MCP tool calls into HomeBox REST calls.
There is no database, no cache and no state: every tool call is one HTTP
request to HomeBox, and the process can be restarted or scaled at will.

## The request path

Running in a cluster behind a gateway:

    Claude Code
      │  MCP over streamable HTTP, Authorization: Bearer <OIDC access token>
      ▼
    Envoy Gateway ── SecurityPolicy: validate JWT, check audience
      │  forwards only if the token is for THIS server's audience
      ▼
    homebox-mcp  (TRANSPORT=http, listening on :8080/mcp)
      │  Authorization: Bearer <HomeBox API key>
      ▼
    HomeBox  /api/v1/...

Two different credentials, and conflating them is the mistake this design
exists to prevent:

- The **caller's** token is an OIDC access token identifying a person. The
  gateway validates it. `homebox-mcp` never reads it.
- The **server's** token is a HomeBox API key, held in a Kubernetes Secret and
  read once at startup. HomeBox accepts nothing else — its OIDC support is a
  browser redirect flow that ends by *issuing* one of these keys.

### The server authenticates nothing

This is deliberate and it is the single most important thing to know before
deploying it. There is no `MCP_AUTH_TOKEN`, no allowlist, no value in the
chart that turns authentication on, because there is none to turn on.

The gateway is the only gate. Exposed directly to a network, the process is
the entire inventory, unauthenticated and writable.

The upside is that authorisation lives in one place that already does it
properly — on hive, Envoy validating a Zitadel-issued JWT against the
`homebox` project audience — rather than in a second, weaker implementation
inside the server.

### One shared identity, and what that costs

Behind the gateway every caller is identical. The server holds one API key
and makes every request with it, so HomeBox attributes every change to that
key rather than to the person who asked for it. **HomeBox's audit trail
cannot tell one user's deletion from another's.**

That is accepted for a household whose users already share a HomeBox group
and can already edit everything through the browser. It is not acceptable
where per-user permissions or an audit trail matter, and fixing it properly
would need the server to exchange the caller's token for a per-user HomeBox
credential — which HomeBox cannot currently issue.

## Package layout

    cmd/homebox-mcp     flags, env, transport selection, signal handling
    internal/homebox    the HTTP client: auth, paths, error and body handling
    internal/server     tool registration; the MCP surface

`internal/server` never builds a URL and `internal/homebox` never knows what
a tool is. That split is what makes it possible to test the tools against a
stub HomeBox without a real one.

### Nothing is modelled

The client passes request and response bodies through as `any`. No structs
mirror HomeBox's types.

This is a deliberate trade. HomeBox's shapes are what its own docs and
swagger describe; a duplicate set of Go structs would add a second source of
truth that silently drops fields the upstream adds, and drift is invisible —
a missing field looks like a HomeBox that did not return it. Passing bodies
through means a HomeBox upgrade that adds a field exposes it immediately.

The cost is that a malformed body is only rejected by HomeBox, not by the
tool. Given the caller is a language model reading tool descriptions, an
error from HomeBox naming the real problem beats a schema error naming a
Go type.

## Three things that are load-bearing

### structuredContent must be an object

MCP requires the structured result to be a JSON object. Several HomeBox
endpoints answer with a top-level array — `/tags`, `/entities/tree`,
`/entities/{id}/path`, `/entities/fields` — and returning one straight
through makes the client reject the response as malformed, with an error
that names schema validation rather than the tool that produced it.

Every non-object response is wrapped: `{"items": [...]}`. This shipped
broken in v0.1.2, when four of eight tools were unusable and the two that
were tested happened to be the two object-shaped ones.

### Annotations are how a client decides what to ask about

Every tool carries MCP `ToolAnnotations`: `readOnlyHint` on reads,
`destructiveHint: false` on creates, `destructiveHint: true` on updates and
deletes. A client uses these to decide what it may call without confirming
first, so an unannotated tool is not a cosmetic omission — it defaults to the
cautious reading and silently loses function.

A test enumerates the registered tools and fails on any that is neither
read-only nor destructive-hinted.

### The write tools paper over three HomeBox behaviours

Left alone, all three lose data while reporting success -- the worst failure
mode a tool can have, because nothing downstream can tell.

**Create keeps three fields.** `POST /entities` applies `name`,
`entityTypeId` and `parentId`, discards the rest of the body, and answers 201.
`homebox_create_entity` follows it with the `PUT` that HomeBox does honour, so
the whole body lands. The second write is skipped when the body holds nothing
that would be dropped.

**Reads give objects, writes take ids.** An entity comes back with `parent`,
`entityType` and `tags` as nested objects; a write accepts `parentId`,
`entityTypeId` and `tagIds`. A `PUT` that omits an id form clears that
relation. So the obvious read-modify-write -- fetch, change one field, send it
back -- unparents the entity and strips its tags, silently, because none of
the id fields were in what you read.

Both write tools translate: for every relation the caller did not set
explicitly, the id is taken from the read shape, in the body if it is there
and from the entity otherwise. Passing `parentId` or `tagIds` still overrides,
so deliberate moves and retagging work.

**PATCH does nothing.** `PATCH /entities/{id}` answers 200 with the unchanged
entity: accepted, not written. `homebox_patch_entity` reads, merges and `PUT`s
instead, which is what a partial update means.

These were all found by loading a real inventory through the tools and then
checking the result, not by reading the API docs. Each is covered by a test
that drives the registered tool against a stub reproducing the quirk.

### The excluded endpoints are a safety boundary, not an oversight

`/actions/*` (including `wipe-inventory`), authentication and API-key
management, group membership, and bulk import/export have no tool. These are
the calls whose damage a model cannot foresee and cannot undo. `/healthz`
likewise does not call HomeBox: a readiness probe that fails when a
dependency blips takes a pod out of service for something restarting cannot
fix.

## Transports

`stdio` is the default, so running the binary with no configuration behaves
the way a local MCP client expects. `http` serves the streamable HTTP
transport at `/mcp`, which is what runs in a cluster; the chart hardcodes it,
because stdio in a pod with no attached client exits immediately.

The HTTP listener binds `0.0.0.0`, not loopback — in a container, binding to
`127.0.0.1` means nothing can reach it, including the kubelet's probes.

## Startup

The server calls `/users/self` once at startup and logs the authenticated
user, email and group. A bad or expired token fails immediately with a clear
message, rather than on the first tool call as a puzzling per-tool error.
